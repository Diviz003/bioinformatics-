Structural and Evolutionary Analysis of LRRK2 N-Terminus 🧬Unlocking the "Missing" Structure of a Key Parkinson's Disease Protein📌 Project OverviewThe Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene is a major genetic contributor to Parkinson's Disease (PD). While its catalytic core (Kinase/GTPase) is well-studied, the massive N-terminal region has remained a "structural black box"—invisible to traditional X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM due to its extreme flexibility.This project combines Phylogenetics (to trace evolutionary history) and Ab Initio Modeling (AlphaFold) to predict the structure and function of this elusive region.🎯 ObjectivesReconstruct the Evolutionary History: Determine if the LRRK2 N-terminus is conserved across mammalian species using Maximum Likelihood phylogenetics.Predict the 3D Structure: Use deep learning (AlphaFold2) to generate a full-length model of the human LRRK2 N-terminus, bypassing the need for experimental templates.Characterize Flexibility: Analyze physicochemical properties and secondary structure to validate the hypothesis that the N-terminus acts as a flexible regulatory scaffold.🛠️ Methodology & Tools1. Phylogenetic AnalysisData Source: UniProt (Human Reference: Q5S007).Homology Search: NCBI BLASTp (Identified vertebrate orthologs).Alignment: Clustal Omega (MSA).Tree Construction: PHYLIP Package (Maximum Likelihood method).Validation: 100 Bootstrap Replicates.Visualization: iTOL (Interactive Tree Of Life).2. Structural Modeling & AnalysisAb Initio Modeling: AlphaFold2 via ColabFold (No homology templates used).Physicochemical Analysis: Expasy ProtParam (Stability, pI, GRAVY).Secondary Structure: SOPMA (Helix/Sheet/Coil prediction).Subcellular Localization: BUSCA (Membrane association prediction).📊 Key Results🧬 PhylogeneticsTopology: The Maximum Likelihood tree showed robust congruence with established mammalian taxonomy.Key Findings:Rodents (Beaver, Chinchilla) formed a distinct monophyletic clade.Primates (Human) clustered as a sister group to rodents (Euarchontoglires).Afrotheria (Golden Mole) was correctly resolved as the basal outgroup.Conclusion: The LRRK2 gene has evolved vertically, confirming the relevance of rodent models for studying human PD.🖥️ Structural Modeling (AlphaFold)Homology Modeling Failed: Traditional tools (SWISS-MODEL) failed due to the lack of experimental templates.AlphaFold Success: Generated a high-confidence full-length model (Average pLDDT: 77.5).The "Missing" Structure:Structured Core: Kinase/GTPase domains predicted with Very High Confidence (pLDDT > 90).Flexible Scaffold: The N-terminus is revealed as a dynamic scaffold rich in Intrinsically Disordered Regions (IDRs) (pLDDT < 50; ~40% Random Coil via SOPMA).Biological validation: ProtParam classified the protein as Unstable (Instability Index > 40), and BUSCA predicted membrane anchoring, supporting the hypothesis that the N-terminus is a flexible "hinge" that regulates kinase activity at the membrane.📂 Repository Structure├── 📁 Data
